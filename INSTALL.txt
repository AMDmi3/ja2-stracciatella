How to build on Linux
---------------------

1. sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libsdl1.2-dev

2. make LNG=ENGLISH

3. Edit file ~/.ja2/ja2.ini,
   set data_dir = path/to/ja2/resources/directory

   For example, on my machine at the time of writing:
     data_dir = /home/user/games/ja2-installed

How to build on Windows
-----------------------

1. Install MinGW from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw

2. Run MinGW Shell from the start menu

3. Download SDL development libraries for MinGW from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   For example, file http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
   Extract this file somewhere, enter the extracted directory from MinGW shell and
   execute: make install-sdl
   SDL development library will be installed into MinGW.

4. From MinGW shell enter directory with JA2 Stracciatella sources.

5. Execute: make LNG=ENGLISH
   File ja2.exe will be built.

6. Copy GCC and SDL runtime DLLs to the folder with ja2.exe
   On my machine at the time of writing the following files are required:
     - C:\MinGW\bin\libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
     - C:\MinGW\bin\libstdc++-6.dll
     - C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\SDL.dll

7. Edit file %USERPROFILE%\Documents\JA2\ja2.ini,
   set data_dir = path/to/ja2/resources/directory

   For example, on my machine at the time of writing:
     data_dir = D:\games\ja2-installed\
