# JA2-Stracciatella Continued

This is continuation of venerable JA2-Stracciatella project.

The goal of the project is to make Jagged Alliance 2 available on a **wide
range of platforms**, improve its **stability**, **fix bugs** and provide a
stable **platform for mod development**.

## History

The original project was run by **Tron** since 2006.  He did an amazing job of
cleaning up JA2 sources and making them portable.  The work was massive too -
there are over *7000 commits* in the [original svn
repository](svn://tron.homeunix.org/ja2/trunk).  Unfortunately, the work on
the project ceased in 2010.
